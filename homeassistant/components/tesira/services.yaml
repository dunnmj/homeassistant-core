# Service ID
danger_bics:
  # If the service action accepts entity IDs, target allows the user to specify
  # entities by entity, device, or area. If `target` is specified, `entity_id`
  # should not be  defined in the `fields` map. By default it shows only targets
  # matching entities from the same domain as the action, but if further
  # customization is required, target supports the entity, device, and area
  # selectors (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/).
  # Entity selector parameters will automatically be applied to device and area,
  # and device selector parameters will automatically be applied to area.
  target:
    entity:
      domain: media_player
